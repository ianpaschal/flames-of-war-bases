# Flames of War Bases
My own 3D-printable bases for Flames of War figures.

## Artillery Optimizations
Artillery optimizations are bases which contain two wheel wells to assist in positioning the artillery piece, as well as improved figure slots.
Wheel wells have 0.2mm clearance between the wheel on the sides and in the radius, and bottom out at 0.5mm below the base surface.

## Legacy Versions
Legacy versions are 2.4mm tall, and have a 4.8mm corner radius.
They are also of an "open" design, to allow metal figures with oddly-shaped bases to be packed into the base with milliput.
